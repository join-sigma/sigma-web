### Guild Rules

#### Discord

* All members must have a Discord account, and check in on Discord regularly, ideally once or twice a day. Raid announcements, guild updates and other information is primarily distributed through Discord. We encourage all members to be active on Discord, as Discord offers access and interaction with other members within the SIGMΔ ALLIANCE community.
* Please keep Discord chat content PG-rated.
* Please do not troll or spam in the Discord chat rooms.
* And remember to be respectful and polite towards others.

#### Tickets:

* Jning Chi you agree to contribute 600 tickets per day.
* Post in #leave_of_absence channel on Discord if you’ll be away from the game and unable to complete tickets.

#### Other Rules:

* Please respect our guild members. Our officers work very hard to make the guild run smoothly. Sometimes mistakes get made. Please be understanding and if you are unhappy with something, or feel you have been treated unfairly, please openly bring it to the attention of an officer or the guild leader.
* A minimum of 2M damage is required by all members in the Sith Raid.
* We require our members to participate in Light Side TB and Dark Side TB as following : 90 Combat Waves in LS TB and 60 CMWs in DS TB
* Participation in Territory War is mandatory and we require each member to get at least 100 Banners every TW

If you are unsure of any of the rules, please ask.


#### Disciplinary

* Penalties for breaking guild rules will be at the discretion of guild leadership. Generally speaking, we’re pretty understanding here in Chi, and have a lot of newer folks, so honest mistakes and minor rule violations are typically handled with a warning.

For more serious violations, we generally use a three-strike system:

* 1st Strike = Do not join the next Rancor Raid
* 2nd Strike = Do not join the HAAT Raid
* 3rd Strike = Potential removal from guild
