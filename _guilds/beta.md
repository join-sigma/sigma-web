* If you will be away from the game for an extended period of time, post in #leave_of_absence

#### Discipline

While warnings and strikes can be handed out for a number of infractions, Beta’s Discipline policy is currently under review and will be updated when finalized.

#### Tickets

Achieving 600 Personal Raid Tickets daily is required.

#### Mercing

If you wish to offer yourself as a Raid Merc to another guild, you are allowed to do so but must get permission from an officer. It is very important that you achieve your 600 tickets before leaving the guild. If you will be away from the guild for more than 1 day, coordinate with an officer so that they can find an account to have cover your 600 tickets.
