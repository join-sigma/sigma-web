### Disciplinary Actions

* Please understand we do not wish to remove or discipline anyone, however, YOU matter to us all. By contributing your 600 energy spent (regular or cantina, NOT daily activity) you show us you care about us all and the welfare of the guild. 600 is mandatory. we are a strict 600 guild. Missing 600 results in missing a raid, your choice which

  * 1 raid offense. Verbal warning (last chance)
  * 2nd raid offense. You do not hit the next raid. Either Rancor or AAT.
  * 3rd raid offense. Removal/ re-invite. You got 0 chance left with me or these good folks you screwed.
  * 4th time missed. You show you don’t care about us, and we don’t care about you. Bye Felicia.
		
* We aren’t messing ’round in here. Zeta WILL be a top guild by us working together. We are here to help each other, not hurt each other. The above mentioned conduct hurts us. We will not allow this guild to be hurt due to anyone slacking or thinking they can break the rules. Nobody is exempt from these rules.
* If you are going to miss your 600 tickets, please let us know IN ADVANCE that you are so we can make arrangements.
